This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Indeed-like jobs website
This basic design is a prototype of the Indeed jobs website. Indeed is an interesting site, as it represents a very minimalist design yet it does everything a candidate or job poster would want.

I have left out auth for this design as I wanted to focus on sketching out the design in Tailwind and providing basic backend support for posting jobs (Prisma / SQLite).

A production site would include full models for candidates, auth, jobs, and additional functionality for recruiters. I would also substitute the SQLite database for PostgreSQL.
